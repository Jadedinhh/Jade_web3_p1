                <h1>Hanoi at a glance</h1>
            <p>Hanoi is Vietnam’s capital city. Located by the banks of the Red River in the northern half of the country, it’s the second largest city in Vietnam by population, behind only Saigon. It served as the capital of French Indochina from 1902-1954, before becoming the capital of a reunified Vietnam after the North’s victory in the Vietnam War.</p>
    
             <p2>Walk along its many tree-lined boulevards and you’ll see that Hanoi is an old city. It celebrated its millennial anniversary in 2010 though it’s said to be much older than that, having been inhabited since at least 3,000 BC. Vestiges of Chinese and French colonial influence are everywhere, particularly in the Old and French Quarters which are home to thousands of colonial-era buildings.</p2>
                
            <p3>
                Known as the “City of Lakes”, Hanoi is home to over two dozen lakes and a climate that mimics the four seasons.

                        <p>Vietnam is still reasonably cheap. As a result, the quality of guesthouses and hotels in Hanoi is extremely high, for the money you’ll pay. Situate yourself in the Old Quarter or near Hoan Kiem Lake, so that you can see all the things to do in Hanoi on foot.</p>
