                        <h4>Where to Stay</h4>
                    <p>Vietnam is still reasonably cheap. As a result, the quality of guesthouses and hotels in Hanoi is extremely high, for the money you’ll pay. Situate yourself in the Old Quarter or near Hoan Kiem Lake, so that you can see all the things to do in Hanoi on foot.</p>

                         <h4>Getting Around</h4>
                    <p>Once in Hanoi, it is relatively easy to get around. Use apps like ‘Grab’ to hire a taxi or bike to take you between destinations. It’s best to opt for a motorbike, over a taxi, because they will find it easier to avoid traffic jams.

                    <p>Tip: When crossing the road, make sure to walk slowly out into the street and directly across, so
                        that traffic can move safely around you.</p>

                      <h4>Best Time to Visit</h4>
                    <p>Unlike other areas in Vietnam, Hanoi is very seasonal. This means winters can be very cold and summers very hot and humid. Because of this, it’s best to visit in the Spring (Feb-April) or the Autumn (October-November).</p>

                        <i class="fas fa-star"></i>
                    <p>Tip: Avoid public holidays, such as TET, as most shops/restaurants will be closed and services
                        will be greatly reduced.</p>

                          <h4>COVID-19 Restrictions</h4>
                    <p>Vietnam has suspended the entry of all foreigners since March 22, 2020, until further notice to
                        limit the spread of COVID-19. The measure will not apply to diplomats, officials, foreign
                        investors, experts, and skilled workers as per Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc.
